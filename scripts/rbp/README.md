# RBP / 3'UTR Scripts

This folder contains scripts for the RBP / 3'UTR section of the project.
All scripts are designed to be run from any working directory by setting `BHLH_PROJECT_ROOT`
(default is the current directory).

## Inputs (generated by the notebook)
- `data/intermediate/rbp/Violin_plot_3UTR.csv`
- `data/intermediate/rbp/RBP_binary_matrix.csv`

These are produced by `notebooks/3'UTR.ipynb`.

## Outputs
All figures are written to `outputs/rbp/figures/` (this folder is intentionally ignored by Git).

## Scripts
- `utr_length_boxplots.R`: 3'UTR length summary boxplots by bHLH class.
- `rbp_vs_utr_scatter_and_hist.R`: scatter (RBP count vs 3'UTR length) + histogram (TFs per RBP), colored by class.
- `rbp_tsne_pam_clusters.R`: t-SNE of RBP binding profiles with PAM clustering.
- `rbp_tsne_hclust_clusters.R`: t-SNE of RBP binding profiles with hierarchical clustering.
- `rbp_tsne_kmodes_clusters.R`: t-SNE of RBP binding profiles with K-modes clustering.
- `rbp_dendrogram_linkage_methods.R`: dendrograms with different linkage methods (labels colored by class).

## R packages
Some scripts require extra packages that may not be installed by default. If a package is missing,
the script will stop with an `install.packages(...)` command you can copy/paste.
